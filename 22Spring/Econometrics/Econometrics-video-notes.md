# Alternative video available
Since Prof Shaw gave us an online course about bootstrap in nls, I uploaded it to my youtube channel, and the link is as below: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/GIF28ruiMeo) . You can only access to the video via the link. I don't have the copyright of the video. All the copyright goes to Prof. Shaw.
