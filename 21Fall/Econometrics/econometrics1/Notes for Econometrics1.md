The course in my year was taught by Professor Phillip Shaw.

This course is mainly on OLS, IV, and Logit/Probit.

For OLS and IV, my suggestion is to follow his class closely. By the way, I have attached his midterm exam contents in the midterm folder. He didn't distribute the exam material after the midterm, so I took a pic when he explained the midterm questions in class. Hope it's helpful for next cohorts who will take his class.

For Logit/Probit, I found he borrowed a lot from the Chapter 17 of **Introductory Econometrics: a Modern Approch (7e)**. Make sure you know everything of 17-1 before final exam.
